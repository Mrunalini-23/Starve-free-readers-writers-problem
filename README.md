Readers-Writers Problem
In classic readers-writers problem ,we make sure that there are no data inconsistencies when there is a shared memory.Here multiple writers processes can not take place concurrently,so we use mutex_wrt semaphore for mutual exclusion between writer processes and mutex for exclusion between reader and writer processes while writer processes taking place.And mutex, mutex_read semaphores are used for exlusion between reader and writer processes and updating rc respectively.Especially we follow first come first serve fashion.# Starve-free-readers-writers-problem
